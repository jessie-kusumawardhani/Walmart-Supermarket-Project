# Walmart Supermarket Sales and Marketing Project

The Walmart supermarket's comprehensive dataset serves as the foundation for evaluating the company's performance, aligning with the analytical objectives of various stakeholders. To provide a holistic assessment, key metrics for both the sales and marketing departments are calculated and presented:

For the Sales Department:

1. Total Annual Gross Sales (GMV): This metric will give us an overview of the company's overall sales performance.
2. Net Profit Ratio (Net Profit Margin to GMV): Calculating the net profit ratio in relation to GMV will help us understand the company's profitability.
3. Sales Development: We will analyze sales development on a month-to-month and year-to-year basis, with a focus on identifying positive trends.
